gramps (4.1.0~dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    This 4.1.0 release of Gramps for Debian has involved a switch to
    Python 3. This change also means an upgrade of the database that
    Gramps uses to store your Family History information. When you
    first run this new version of Gramps you will receive a warning
    that your data is about to be converted to the new database format,
    and that you will not be able to open the database in an older
    version of Gramps in the future.
    As a precaution, if you do not have a backup of your Family Trees
    (preferably in Gramps XML format), it is recommended that you copy
    the directory with your Family Tree Database (usually ~/.gramps
    unless you set it to a different place in Gramps Preferences) to a
    safe place before opening one of your family trees in the new
    version of Gramps. This is just in case something happens
    that causes you to revert to your previous version of Gramps.
