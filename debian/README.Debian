gramps for Debian
-----------------

python-webkit is "Suggested" as upstream states it as optional in their README file. According to upstream, webkit needs to be tested for stability for Gramps (it is used in the hidden HTML View). If it is unstable, it may be necessary to revert to gecko (python-gtkmozembed).
