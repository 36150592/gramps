gramps for Debian
----------------------

This is the Debian package of the 4.0 series of GRAMPS.

It is a major update of Gramps to upgrade to GTK 3. A switch was also made to distutils from autotools.

The 4.0 series of Gramps is being packaged for the experimental distribution until all dependencies are available
and it proves stable.
